This is a Website in which you can communicate with your senior citizens nearby in your home town, and deliver them food like they would have a resturant. Many Senior citizens in your area do not have access to food, so contact us if you want to volunteer or help.

This is a website cread by Github
======
This Website was meant to be able to connect many different people to Seniors and to help volunteer.

There are several features on this website to let you help at your own convience.

Getting started
======

1. Check your email for a response on the senior you will be helping, and the kinds of food restrictions they have.
1. Cook the food that they would like, and contact them to make sure it is okay [this is thier contact info](http://archive.is/3TPas).

Purpose
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.

More info about this can be found in the information page [info](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/), or by [contacting me](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/). Thank you for your time.
