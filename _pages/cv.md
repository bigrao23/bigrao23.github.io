We made this website to help Senior Citizens in our community. People are unaware that many people in your community are looking to help out Senior Citizens, or volunteer in any way they can. I have lived in Mountain View for many years, and since I have lived here, a really nice lady has lived across the street from me. She has lived for a long time and has many stories to tell, but has trouble getting out of the house, and even getting groceries or anything from outside. When we delivered her a meal, she was overjoyed that we could take time, make a meal, and share it with her. Similar to my experience, many Senior Citizens are unable to get food from restaurants, or would like volunteers to cook them a home meal once in a while. That is why we created this website, to help Senior Citizens.


  
Our Mission Statement

To help people in need, and to help volunteers and Senior Citizens feel fulfilled and enjoy a meal.
