This is a website where Volunteers can contact Seniors and they can deliver food. Here is the [Contact Page](https://bigrao23.github.io/markdown/).

A Senior Citizen Website
======
Like many other Senior citizen websites, you can go around helping all the senior you want. 

Getting started
======
1. If you are a Senior Citizen, go to the seniors page above test.
1. If you are a volunteer, go to the volunteers page.
1. As a Senior, you will need to put in information about what kind of food you like of want, and what times are best for you.
1. If you are a volunteer, after entering your info, check your email for what food the senior you are assigned to wants.
1. The last step is to deliver the food.
