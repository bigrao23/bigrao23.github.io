I am passionate about food and I enjoy cooking. With this lockdown I am cooking more time in hand. Then suddenly, I had an idea. The Covid-19 pandemic has created huge isolation in our communities. I want to help out throughout the communities, and help out Senior citizens by combining my passions of technology and cooking. This is my effort to combine my passions to help out my community. Eventually hope to connect with other similar minded peeople through technology to offer this service in many communities.
